Version 3, 19 November 2007

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. Definitions.

"License" refers to this GNU Affero General Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.

"Modified Version" refers to any work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.

"User" refers to anyone interacting with the Program over a network, using a modified version of the Program on a server, or receiving content produced by the Program from a server.

1. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.

2. Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

3. User's Rights.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.

4. Acceptance of License.

We protect your rights under this License and other applicable licenses.

To apply the terms and conditions of this License to a given Program (Software), which is free software.

To apply the same License terms and conditions to a given Program, under the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3, under the terms of this license.

If the license of any work you distribute gives you permission to distribute the Software, we are free to do so.

End of terms and conditions of the GNU Affero General Public License and the, modified, into another language.
